# hello-world
just another repository

Hello everyone, my name is Manuel Villoria, I'm 20 years old and live in Caracas, Venezuela. I'm new in the programming world, 
so, I got a lot to learn! 
Currently, I'm studiying telecomunication's engineering at the Andres Bello Catholic University in Caracas. I've done few jobs 
with C++, Java, DOS, and Python. All in a small and basic level. I'll be working to do greater jobs in the future

Also, I like to learn languages (not just programming haha), I do speak spanish and english, got medium proficiency in Italian, French and Norwegian. 
Oh almost forgot it! I love to play my guitar.

thanks for reading!
